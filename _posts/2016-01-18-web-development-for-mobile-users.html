<p>Today, the internet is viewed by all kinds of devices. These devices generally browse for content using some form of client browser that's written to run on that particular device. And, as developers we've accepted the fact browser choice is a freedom outside of work and sometimes a specification at work. In the workplace there may be no choice. It may be version 13.4 of Internet Explorer and now shut up about it. Enter Browser Wars. It's a game played by all browser-interested parties and web developers hate it. To add to all this confusion, everyone with a data-device (Internet-ready), watches, cell phones, iPads, tablets, laptops big and small, and anything else the world can dream up wants to look at stuff on the internet. We've almost stopped watching TV. We look at monitors and screens now.</p>

<p>For quite some time, this situation was vicious for the web developer. Things are better now but not entirely perfect. We do, however realize that you may want a hosted product that can be used by your office staff indoors and your sales team in the field or on the road. Our development will not box you into doing business our way. These are your dreams. We'll do what you want. If you want an entirely mobile solution we'll do that. And, if you want the best of both worlds we'll do that. There are many architecture options available to all of us today and we can tailor our solution to you. We're flexible. There's no right answer. We will produce the software solution that fits your requirements and provides world-class results.</p>

<p>Contact us today. We want you to realize your dreams and value us as a partner in the collaborative design of your next big thing. As CEO of CI Wise, I want to personally guarantee your satisfaction with us and our work. Call me directly at 919-605-6529. My name is David L. Whitehurst and I'll take your calls as long as I can. And, if I don't answer directly, please leave me a message. I will get back to you.</p>
