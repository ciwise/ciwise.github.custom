I've used languages like SAS, Forth, COBOL, Fortran, Pascal, Basic, Visual Basic, C, C++, Java, Perl, Python, Groovy, Ruby, Scala, and Javascript. I've written web applications for user clients like BMW North America, Honda, Acura, Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, Owens Corning, Lenscrafter, Michael J. Fox Foundation, Charles Schwab, RBC Bank, State Farm, AllState, Nationwide, NC Department of Agriculture, and the North Carolina Department of Transportation. I have performance tuned the shared Confluence wiki for Yale, Princeton, and Rutgers Universities. I set up JBoss development environments on datacenter infrastructures for the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation and the North Carolina Department of Transportation.</p>
