<p>Enterprise architecture as we know it is changing quickly. Technology is moving so fast that's it's almost impossible to keep up with it. While our new competitors may be hosting their applications on virtual servers in the cloud, we may have made huge investments in our own infrastructure. We don't believe the infrastructure is as important as the instructions that run that infrastructure. This software, these configurations, and specific instructions make up the operating-side of the enterprise architecture as a whole. While your focus should be a continual assessment of the ROI as it relates to your current enterprise architecture, don't ignore the possibility for change. A small investment today may cause a continued improvement in profit tomorrow.</p>
