<p>Enterprise software development today is very tricky. And, it's quite expensive. You may have an incongruent mess of applied technology that's outdated and not performing well. You may be thinking about a new IT startup business and don't know where to begin. The choice of technology today is overwhelming. You can have it all but you need a planand that's difficult. Maybe your software as a service (SaaS) application is outdated, performing poorly, difficult to maintain, and your expert developers have chased the recruiters to another hot opportunity. As an enterprise in the IT space, you need to change with the technology, costly or otherwise. And, whether the paradigm of the day models inequitable employees that hold no sense of ownership, you need to train your development staff. Fact.</p>

<p>Talented enterprise developers also acquire business knowledge. And, this may be more valuable than their knowledge of the current technologies. We'll get to those in those in the next paragraph. The business knowledge is proprietary and most valuable to you as an employer. And, I haven't seen many easy-to-understand applications at any place of business. In the last decade I've  developed new applications and worked on existing applications of all kinds. My position has always been one where I fixed the most difficult problems or roughed out the architecture of complex business problems.</p> 

<p>Changes in technology should be secondary. The business requirement should be fixed. And, yet to be competitive we know that business changes as needed. Let's consider a high-level business requirement that doesn't change. There are many ways to deliver software that satisfies this requirement. And, the implementation may take some time to complete. There can be many solutions ranging from useless to delightful. Sometimes an excellent solution becomes slow and very difficult to manage and/or change. This is not usually the case because the design was not considered or scalability factors were not discussed initially. Quite often, long-running software projects do not refactor on an architectural scale. This is almost imperative today.</p>

<p>Sometimes architectures change beyond patterns yet to be documented. An example of this is responsive web design. Enterprise adopted Java early on and I bet many commercial or proprietary web applications, still hosted on server clusters, are slow today and provide an almost irritating user experience. And, why are these applications not fixed right away? Well, this is quite possibly because the team of developers, that didn't write the first version of the application, are spending most of their time trying to understand the original business requirements. The technology they brought with them isn't helping their understanding of the business logic. I'll ask another question. Why can't this group refactor the entire application on an architectural,technology, or platform level? It's because the business can't accept the fact that they need to be as agile as their competition. Or, could it be that their staff doesn't have the expertise to refactor the application architecture?</p>

<p>I don't know whether responsive web design is well-documented at this point or considered to be an architecture pattern. It should be. The original developers that created our bloated old MVC server monolith learned about it from some open source site or from an AngularJS Youtube video. I found that my wife was getting tired of me being buried in an IRC client (geek chat room) and spending long hours training myself for my next gig. While you pay your developers to work on your outdated applications (investments) that increase in cost of ownership daily, they're staying up late nights so they can go to work somewhere they feel a sense of ownership and experience the success of their hard work.</p>

<p>We can train your developers to refactor your enterprise applications to use current technologies. We can also help you plan for platform changes if needed. Best of all, we can train your development staff to be world-class because the open source community overall has set the gold-standard for how-to implement quality-tested, bug-free, and truly-secure software code. We will customize our training to support your needs, however we will suggest changes and recommend acceptable options during initial consultations. Our job is to ultimately improve your enterprise software, provide your developers current and practical training, and automate a solid, more agile process. Open-mindedness and acceptance to change is a psychological trait. Process changes occur with executive and managerial directives. Witnessing the success of your team makes it process adoption and not process direction. Are you open to that?</p>

<p>Contact us today. We want you to realize your dreams and value us as a partner in the collaborative design of your next big thing. As CEO of CI Wise, I want to personally guarantee your satisfaction with us and our work. Call me directly at 919-605-6529. My name is David L. Whitehurst and I'll take your calls as long as I can. And, if I don't answer directly, please leave me a message. I will get back to you.</p>
