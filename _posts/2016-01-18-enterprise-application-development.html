<p>Application development is costly any way you look at it. Sometimes it looks like all is well and then you're nearing a deadline with some issue that's going to cause significant delays. We're here to help. We can place someone on a part-time basis to help you finish up and meet your deadline. Our consultant/contractors are carefully chosen to be in agreement with my strong principles, character traits, and work ethic. </p>

<p>If you're looking for a development team, we'll build it for you. We can hire the team and implement the software for you. Or we can hire and build a successful team to leave with you when our guidance is no longer needed. We can also contract with you on a temporary basis and provide team leadership or agile training until the team is ready to operate independently.</p> 

<p>Contact us today. We want you to realize your dreams and value us as a partner in the collaborative design of your next big thing. As CEO of CI Wise, I want to personally guarantee your satisfaction with us and our work. Call me directly at 919-605-6529. My name is David L. Whitehurst and I'll take your calls as long as I can. And, if I don't answer directly, please leave me a message. I will get back to you.</p>
