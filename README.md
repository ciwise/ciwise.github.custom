## ciwise.github.custom
GitHub Pages Repository w/Build Across Projects

This repository contains the Jekyll project for my company site ciwise.com and we're thinking about adding a branch for ciwise.org. This Jekyll project adds some extra features for pagination that Github doesn't support. The configuration YAML file does, however specify the destination directory for the static website that's built with the Jekyll command build. This project will be committed to Github at the same time that any destination static sites for GitHub Pages are committed.
